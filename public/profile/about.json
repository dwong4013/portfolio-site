    "about": "If you told me a couple years ago that I'd be creating mobile-responsive web apps with React and RESTful APIs with Nodejs and MongoDB, I would have no idea what any of that means, but I'd be totally down to do it. \n\n That's how I tend to face all challenges. I find that I'm often too distracted by figuring out how things work, that I don't dwell on how difficult something is. \n\n Today, I'm looking to be part of a team to help turn bold ideas into mission critical software for businesses.",
