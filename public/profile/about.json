    "about": "From the moment I was born, I loved eating.\n\n Later I learned about weight training and calisthenics, and I loved fitness because it lets me eat more. \n\n After completing my undergrad, I took a detour with an ecommerce startup where I discovered my next passion. \n\n I learned to utilize technology to increase productivity and reduce errors in my tasks. \n\n Now my goal is to create technology that many users will rely on to improve their work quality.",
